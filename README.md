# checkersAI
This is a checkers game built off of a tutorial by Tech With Tim (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)

In this checkers game, there were a couple of bugs in the algorithm, namely:
- you could not multi jump into a king piece with the red pieces
- the king could not capture pieces both foward and back

In order to fix this I implemented those capabilities using my own algorithm
