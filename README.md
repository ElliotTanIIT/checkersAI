# checkersAI
This is a checkers game built off of a tutorial by Tech With Tim, I encourage people to check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg

In this checkers game, there were a couple of bugs in the algorithm, namely:
- you could not multi jump into a king piece with the red pieces
- the king could not capture pieces both foward and back in the same turn

In order to fix this I implemented those capabilities using my own algorithm before starting on doing the AI
